# YouTube Subscriptions List View Fix

## Description
This Chrome extension restores the classic **list view** layout for the YouTube subscriptions feed, replacing the modern forced grid view. It enforces a horizontal layout with fixed 16:9 thumbnails (300px width) and aligns metadata to the right for better readability and information density.

**Key Features:**
* Forces horizontal layout (Thumbnail | Text).
* Fixes thumbnail aspect ratio to strict 16:9 (prevents vertical/square cropping).
* Hides "Shorts" shelves and other clutter from the subscription feed.
